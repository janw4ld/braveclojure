# Session 1

The book's first two chapters are about setting up a dev env that consists of

- `leiningen`, as a build tool and task runner
- `Emacs`, for code editing 
- `nREPL` & `cider`, for an emacs builtin repl with QoL features

I made a neovim setup with 
- `clojure-lsp`, `cljfmt`, `nvim-paredit`, for editing QoL and magic
- `nREPL`, `cider` & `conjure`, for a neovim repl

and scaffolded a project with build scripts using the clojure cli `clj` & the
`clojure/tools.build` library.
