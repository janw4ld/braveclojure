# Session 2

i worked through the rest of chapter 3, which explains how functions work in
clojure, and messed around with other things i was curious about -like the official
pattern matching library `core.match`-. i also switched to a more opinionated
formatter `zprint`, not sure if i prefer it over `cljfmt` tho.
